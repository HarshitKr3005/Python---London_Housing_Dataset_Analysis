# Python---London_Housing_Dataset_Analysis

This dataset is primarily centered around the housing market of London. It contains a lot of additional relevant data:

• Monthly average house prices

• Yearly number of houses sold

• Monthly number of crimes committed

The data used here is from year 1995 to 2019 of each different area.

This data is available as a CSV file, downloaded from Kaggle.

I will analyze this data using the Pandas DataFrame.

Here, random sets of questions are given for which I have to find correct results.
